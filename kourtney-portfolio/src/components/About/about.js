        I am an entry-level Front-End Web Developer eager to gain experience in the field.
          Recently, I completed the Full Stack Web Development Program at The University of Texas at Austin, where I learned new coding languages
          and added many projects to my portfolio. My background working in both client-facing and employee-facing roles makes
          me an excellent communicator and problem solver. I am driven by producing quality and measurable results for my clients and keeping my team grounded and on track.
         I specialize in designing graphics and the look of an application but Iâ€™m also dedicated to perfecting the functionality of it as well.
          I welcome new and exciting opportunities where I can learn, thrive, and help my clientele at the same time.
